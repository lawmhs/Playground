This is a kudzu folder that includes:

A basic prime number sieve
A coroutine number printer using libtask
Testing ground for calling cython through C and hopefully calling python through C calling cython.

Lots of commented out code, and is a general mess as it is sort of a sandbox project.

Makefile_Old is for libtask stuff
Makefile is for the current exploration of cython and whatnot
